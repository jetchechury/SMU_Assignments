## Introduction
The following report is a summary of the analysis conducted on the district-wide standardized test results.  All studentâ€™s math and reading scores, as well as school budget and size were included in the analysis.  The data was aggregated in order to showcase the obvious trends in school performance to better make decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

## Recommendations/Conclusions
* Prior to making any final conclusions based on the analysis presented, special student populations, such as special education and section 504, and the services offered at each campus also should be taken into account.
* The analysis shows that schools with lower per student spending produced higher score averages.  It would be beneficial to further investigate how the schools that report higher per student spending are allocating their funds, and if those funds need to be re-allocated to other areas to help improve test scores.
* Overall it appears that the Charter schools are out performing the District schools.  Further comparison of scores, size and spending between the Charter schools and District schools could give insight into the factors that allow the Charter schools to produce higher test scores.
