## Background

The purpose of this assignment was to organize 'UFO eyewitness accounts' using a medium that could be shared with others. Due to the size of the data set, it was necessary to create a dynamic table that could be sorted using filters. This assignment was completed using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js. 

## The Process

A basic HTML web page was created.  Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, code was developed that appeneded a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting. Using multiple `input` tags, JavaScript code was written so that the user could set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using date/time, city, state, country and/or shape.
