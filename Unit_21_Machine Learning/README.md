# Machine Learning - Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.  To help process this data, machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset were created.
